If you want auto-reload:

1. `npm install -g live-server`
2. Run `live-server` in the dir where index.html is

Note: live-server navigation works for full links i.e ./writings.html
instead of ./writings

If you don't want auto reload:

1. Run `open index.html`

or

1. Install http-server `brew install http-server`
2. Run `http-server`

or

1. (with python installed) run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
